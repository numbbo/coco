Two Interpretation Of Instances
================================

Different instances of each function are used when collecting the number of function evaluations needed to reach a target for a given function. Those instances correspond to different instantiations of the (random) transformations applied to the raw functions behind the construction of the test functions. (A transformation can be a random rotation of the search space, ...)

We interpret the different instances in two different manner:

Pure repetition
***************

First of all, we interpret the different instances as if they are just a repetition of the same function. In this case we consider the run length collected on the different instances (for a given function and target) as independent identically distributed random variables. This interpretation is important for our construction of the simulated run-length and the computation of the ERT performance measure.


Instances are actually different

Bootstrapping and Simulated Runs
================================

The |ERT| computes a single measurement from a data sample set (in our case
from |nruns| optimization runs). Bootstrapping [Efron:1993]_ can provide a
dispersion measure for this aggregated measurement: here, a "single data
sample" is derived from the original data by repeatedly drawing single trials
with replacement until a successful trial is drawn. We call also this single data sample a **simulated run**.	

The running time of the
single sample is computed as the sum of function evaluations in the drawn
trials (for the last trial up to where the target function value is reached)
[Auger:2005b]_ [Auger:2009]_. The distribution of the
bootstrapped running times is, besides its displacement, a good approximation
of the true distribution. We provide some percentiles of the bootstrapped
distribution.

Simulated runs are heavily used for displaying the distribution.
