  COCO is a platform for Comparing Continuous Optimizers in a black-box
  setting. 
  It aims at automatizing the tedious and repetitive task of
  benchmarking numerical optimization algorithms to the greatest possible
  extent. 
  We present the rationals behind the development of the platform
  as a general proposition for a guideline towards better benchmarking. 
  We detail underlying fundamental concepts of 
  COCO such as its definition of
  a problem, the idea of instances, the relevance of target values and runtime
  as central performance measure. 
  Finally, we  give a quick overview of the basic
  code structure and the available test suites.

Introduction
============

We consider the continuous black-box optimization or search problem to minimize

.. math::

    f: X\subset\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m \qquad n,m\ge1 

such that for the |l| constraints

.. math::

    g: X\subset\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^l \qquad l\ge0 

we have :math:`g_i(\x)\le0` for all :math:`i=1\dots l`.
More specifically, we aim to find, as quickly as possible, one or several solutions |x| in the search space :math:`X` with *small* value(s) of :math:`f(\x)\in\mathbb{R}^m` that satisfy all above constraints |g|. 
We consider *time* to be defined as the number of calls to the function |f|. 

A continuous optimization algorithm, also known as *solver*, addresses the
above problem. 
Here, we assume that :math:`X` is known, but no prior knowledge about |f| or
|g| is available to the algorithm. 
That is, |f| and |g| are considered as a black-box which the algorithm can
query with solutions :math:`\x\in\mathbb{R}^n` to get the respective values
:math:`f(\x)` and :math:`g(\x)`.

From these prerequisits, benchmarking optimization algorithms seems to be a
rather simple and straightforward task. We run an algorithm on a collection of
problems and display the results. However, under closer inspection,
benchmarking turns out to be surprisingly tedious, and it appears to be
difficult to get results that can be meaningfully interpreted beyond the
standard claim that one algorithm is better than another on some problems. [#]_ 
Here, we offer a conceptual guideline for benchmarking
continuous optimization algorithms which tries to address this challenge and
has been implemented within the COCO_ framework. [#]_ 

The COCO_ framework provides the practical means for an automatized
benchmarking procedure. Installing COCO_ (in a shell) and benchmarking an
optimization algorithm, say, implemented in the function ``fmin`` in Python,
becomes as simple as

    in Figure 1. \begin{figure} %\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}

     $ git clone https://github.com/numbbo/coco.git  # get coco

  observer = cocoex.Observer("bbob", "result_folder: myoptimizer-on-bbob")
    
  for p in suite:  # loop over all problems
      observer.observe(p)  # prepare logging of necessary data
      fmin(p, p.initial_solution)
        
  cocopp.main('exdata/myoptimizer-on-bbob')  # invoke data post-processing

    \end{figure}

The COCO_ framework provides currently

 - an interface to several languages in which the benchmarked optimizer
   can be written, currently C/C++, Java, Matlab/Octave, Python
 - several benchmark suites or testbeds, currently all written in C
 - data logging facilities via the ``Observer``
 - data post-processing in Python and data display facilities in ``html``
 - article LaTeX templates

The underlying philosophy of COCO_ is to provide everything which otherwise
most experimenters needed to setup and implement themselves, if they wanted to
benchmark an algorithm properly. So far, the framework has been used successfully for
benchmarking far over a hundred algorithms by many researchers.  

.. [#] One major flaw is that we often get no
   indication of *how much* better an algorithm is. 
   That is, the results of benchmarking often provide no indication of 
   *relevance*;
   the main output often consists of hundreds of tabulated numbers
   only interpretable on an *ordinal scale* [STE1946]_. Addressing a point of a
   common confusion, *statistical significance* is only a secondary, and by no
   means a *sufficient* condition for *relevance*.

.. Anne: benchmarking / challenge sessions are still popular because the people have the
.. Anne: feeling they do more work (hence it's better). More precisely while they do not focus on
.. Anne: the difficult task of designing a good algorithm (only need a small fancy idea like 
.. Anne: imitating the fly of a chicken), they still have the feeling they achieve a consequent work 
.. Anne: because they focus on implementing those long tests and writing their data in the latex.

.. Niko: I see your point, but I am not sure I am ready to even mention that 
  unnecessary work is not an achievement in itself. Secondly, at the moment
  I don't want to push the design aspect, because I don't think *heavily* using an
  entire COCO suite during the design process is usually the right way to go. This is
  probably a point which should be made though, but a rather lengthy argument to make.

Why COCO_?
----------

Appart from diminishing the burden (time) and the pitfalls (and bugs
or omissions) of the repetitive coding task by many experimenters, our aim is to
provide a *conceptual guideline for better benchmarking*. Our guideline has 
the following defining features.  

.. format hint: four spaces are needed to make the continuation
     https://gist.github.com/dupuy/1855764

#. Benchmark functions are 
    #. used as black boxes for the algorithm, however they 
       are explicitly known to the scientific community. 
    #. designed to be comprehensible, to allow a meaningful 
       interpretation of performance results.
    #. difficult to "defeat", that is, they do not 
       have artificial regularities that can be (intentionally or unintentionally) 
       exploited by an algorithm. [#]_
    #. scalable with the input dimension [WHI1996]_.

#. There is no predefined budget (number of |f|-evaluations) for running an
   experiment, the experimental procedure is *budget-free* [BBO2016ex]_.

#. A single performance measure is used --- and thereafter aggregated and 
   displayed in 
   several ways --- namely **runtime**, *measured in 
   number of* |f|-*evaluations* [BBO2016perf]_. Runtime has the advantages to 

   - be independent of the computational platform, language, compiler, coding 
     styles, and other specific experimental conditions [#]_
   - be relevant, meaningful and easily interpretable without expert domain knowledge
   - be quantitative on the ratio scale [STE1946]_ [#]_
   - assume a wide range of values 
   - aggregate over a collection of values in a meaningful way
     
   A *missing* runtime value is considered as possible outcome (see below).
    
#. The display is as comprehensible, intuitive and informative as possible, 
   We believe that details matter. 
   Aggregation over dimension is avoided, because dimension is an a priori
   known parameter that can and should be used for algorithm design or selection
   decisions. 

.. [#] For example, the optimum is not in all-zeros, optima are not placed 
    on a regular grid, most functions are not separable [WHI1996]_. The
    objective to remain comprehensible makes it more challenging to design
    non-regular functions. Which regularities are common place in real-world
    optimization problems remains an open question. 

.. [#] Runtimes measured in |f|-evaluations are widely
       comparable and designed to stay. The experimental procedure
       [BBO2016exp] includes however a timing experiment which records the
       internal computational effort of the algorithm in CPU or wall clock time.

       achieved after a given budget.

Terminology
-----------

We specify a few terms which are used later. 

*function*
  We talk about a *function* as a parametrized mapping
  :math:`\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m` with scalable input space, and usually :math:`m\in\{1,2\}`.
  Functions are parametrized such that different *instances* of the
  "same" function are available, e.g. translated or shifted versions. 
  
*problem*
  We talk about a *problem*, |coco_problem_t|_, as a specific *function
  instance* on which an optimization algorithm is run. 
  A problem
  can be evaluated and returns an |f|-value or -vector and, in case,
  a |g|-vector. 
  In the context of performance assessment, a target :math:`f`- or
  indicator-value is added to define a problem. 
  
*runtime*
  We define *runtime*, or *run-length* [HOO1998]_ as the *number of
  evaluations* conducted on a given problem until a prescribed target value is
  hit, also referred to as number of *function* evaluations or |f|-evaluations.
  Runtime is our central performance measure.

*suite*
  A test- or benchmark-suite is a collection of problems, typically between
  twenty and a hundred, where the number of objectives :math:`m` is fixed. 


.. |n| replace:: :math:`n`
.. |m| replace:: :math:`m`
.. |theta| replace:: :math:`\theta`
.. |i| replace:: :math:`i`
.. |j| replace:: :math:`j`
.. |t| replace:: :math:`t`
.. |fi| replace:: :math:`f_i`


Functions, Instances, Problems, and Targets 
============================================

In the COCO_ framework we consider **functions**, |fi|, for each suite
distinguished by their identifier :math:`i=1,2,\dots` .  
Functions are further
*parametrized* by the (input) dimension, |n|, and the instance number, |j|, [#]_
that is, for a given |m| we have

.. math::

    \finstance_i \equiv f(n, i, j):\R^n \to \mathbb{R}^m \quad
    \x \mapsto \finstance_i (\x) = f(n, i, j)(\x)\enspace. 
    
Varying |n| or |j| leads to a variation of the same function
|i| of a given suite. 
By fixing |n| and |j| for function |fi|, we define an optimization **problem**
:math:`(n, i, j)\equiv(f_i, n, j)` that can be presented to the optimization algorithm. Each problem receives again
an index in the suite, mapping the triple :math:`(n, i, j)` to a single
number. 


.. The Instance Concept
   -----------------------

As the formalization above suggests, the differentiation between function (index) 
and instance index is of purely semantic nature. 
This semantics however is important in how we display and
interpret the results. We interpret **varying the instance** parameter as 
a natural randomization for experiments [#]_ in order to 

 - generate repetitions on a function and
 - average away irrelevant aspects of a function thereby providing
    - generality which alleviates the problem of overfitting, and
    - a fair setup which prevents intentional or unintentional exploitation of 
      irrelevant or artificial function properties. 

For example, we consider the absolute location of the optimum not a defining
function feature. Consequently, in a typical COCO_ benchmark suite, instances
with randomized search space translations are presented to the optimizer. [#]_


.. [#] We can think of |j| as a continuous parameter vector, as it 
   parametrizes, among others things, translations and rotations. In practice, 
   |j| is a discrete identifier for single instantiations of these parameters. 


.. [#] Changing or sweeping through a relevant feature of the problem class,
       systematically or randomized, is another possible usage of instance
       parametrization. 

.. [#] Conducting either several trials on instances with randomized search space
   translations or with a randomized initial solution is equivalent, given
   that the optimizer behaves translation invariant (disregarding domain
   boundaries). 


Runtime and Target Values
=========================

In order to measure the runtime of an algorithm on a problem, we
establish a hitting time condition. 
We prescribe a **target value**, |t|, which is an |f|- or
indicator-value [BBO2016biobj]_. 
For a single run, when an algorithm reaches or surpasses the target value |t|
on problem |p|, we say it has *solved the problem* |pt| --- it was successful. [#]_

Now, the **runtime** is the evaluation count when the target value |t| was
reached or surpassed for the first time. 
That is, runtime is the number of |f|-evaluations needed to solve the problem
|pt| (but see also Recommendations_ in [BBO2016ex]_). [#]_
*Measured runtimes are the only way of how we assess the performance of an 
algorithm.* [#]_

.. Runtime can be formally written as |RT(pt)|. 

.. _Recommendations: https://www.github.com

.. old For each target value, |t|, the quadruple :math:`(f_i, n, j, t)` gives 
       raise to a runtime, |RT(pt)|, 
   When the problem :math:`(f_i, n, j)` has been solved up to the target quality |t|. 
   An algorithm solves a problem |pt| if it hits the target |t|. 
   In the context of performance evaluation, we refer to such a quadruple itself also as a *problem*. 

If an algorithm does not hit the target in a single run, the runtime remains 
undefined --- while
it has been bound to be at least :math:`k+1`, where |k| is the number of 
evaluations in this unsuccessful run. 
The number of defined runtime values depends on the budget the 
algorithm has explored. 
Therefore, larger budgets are preferable --- however they should not come at
the expense of abandoning reasonable termination conditions. Instead,
restarts should be done. 

.. [#] Note the use of the term *problem* in two meanings: as the problem the
    algorithm is benchmarked on, |p|, and as the problem, |pt|, an algorithm can
    solve by hitting the target |t| with the runtime, |RT(pt)|, or may fail to solve. 
    Each problem |p| gives raise to a collection of dependent problems |pt|. 
    Viewed as random variables, the events |RT(pt)| given |p| are not
    independent events for different values of |t|. 
  
.. [#] Target values are directly linked to a problem, leaving the burden to 
    properly define the targets with the designer of the benchmark suite. 
    The alternative is to present final |f|- or indicator-values as results,
    leaving the (rather unsurmountable) burden to interpret these values to the
    reader. 
    Fortunately, there is an automatized generic way to generate target values
    from observed runtimes, the so-called run-length based target values
    [BBO2016perf]_. 
    
.. [#] Observed success rates can (and should) be translated into lower bounds 
    on runtimes on a subset of problems. 

.. |k| replace:: :math:`k`
.. |p| replace:: :math:`(f_i, n, j)`
.. |pt| replace:: :math:`(f_i, n, j, t)`
.. |RT(pt)| replace:: :math:`\mathrm{RT}(f_i, n, j, t)`


.. _sec:Restarts:

Restarts and Simulated Restarts
-------------------------------

An optimization algorithm is bound to terminate and, in the single-objective case, return a recommended 
solution, |x|, for the problem, |p|. 
It solves thereby all problems |pt| for which :math:`f(\x)\le t`. 
Independent restarts from different, randomized initial solutions are a simple
but powerful tool to increase the number of solved problems [HAR1999]_ --- namely by increasing the number of |t|-values, for which the problem |p|
was solved. [#]_ 
Independent restarts tend to increase the success rate, but they generally do
not *change* the performance *assessment*, because the successes materialize at
greater runtimes. 
Therefore, we call our approach *budget-free*. 
Restarts however "*improve the reliability, comparability, precision, and "visibility" of the measured results*" [BBO2016ex]_.

*Simulated restarts* [HAN2010]_ [HAN2010b]_ [BBO2016perf]_ are used to determine a runtime for unsuccessful runs. Semantically, this is only valid if we interpret different 
instances as random repetitions. 
Resembling the bootstrapping method [EFR1993]_, when we face an unsolved problem, we draw uniformly at random a
new |j| until we find an instance such that |pt| was solved. [#]_
The evaluations done on the first unsolved problem and on all subsequently
drawn unsolved problems are added to the runtime on the last problem and
are considered as runtime on the original unsolved problem.  
This method is applied if a problem instance was not solved and is
(only) available if at least one problem instance was solved.

.. The minimum runtime determined by a simulated restart is the 
   minimum runtime from those solved instances which are accompanied by at least
   one unsolved instance (that is, for the same |pt| except of |j|).


.. [#] For a given problem |p|, the number of acquired runtime values, |RT(pt)|
  is monotonously increasing with the budget used. Considered as random
  variables, these runtimes are not independent. 

.. [#] More specifically, we consider the problems :math:`(f_i, n, j, t(j))` for
  all benchmarked instances |j|. The targets :math:`t(j)` depend on the instance 
  in a way to make the problems comparable [BBO2016perf]_. 


Aggregation
------------

A typical benchmark suite consists of about 20--100 functions with 5--15 instances for each function. For each instance, up to about 100 targets are considered for the 
performance assessment. This means we want to consider at least :math:`20\times5=100`, and 
up to :math:`100\times15\times100=150\,000` runtimes for the performance assessment. 
To make them amenable to the experimenter, we need to summarize these data. 


Our idea behind an aggregation is to make a statistical summary over a set or
subset of *problems of interest* over which we assume a uniform distribution [BBO2016perf]_. 
From a practical perspective this means to have no simple way to distinguish
between these problems and to select an optimization algorithm accordingly---in
which case an aggregation would have no significance---and that we are likely
to face each problem with similar probability. 
We do not aggregate over dimension, because dimension can and 
should be used for algorithm selection. 

We have several ways to aggregate the resulting runtimes. 

 - Empirical cumulative distribution functions (|ECDFs|). In the domain of 
   optimization, |ECDFs| are also known as *data profiles* [MOR2009]_. We
   prefer the simple |ECDF| over the more innovative performance profiles
   [MOR2002]_ for two reasons.
   |ECDFs| (i) do not depend on other presented algorithms, that is, they are
   entirely comparable across different publications, and (ii) let us distinguish in a
   natural way easy problems from difficult problems for the considered
   algorithm. We usually display |ECDFs| on the log scale, which makes the area
   above the curve and the *difference area* between two curves a meaningful
   conception [BBO2016perf]_. 
   
   .. object/concept/element/notion/aspect/component. 
 
 - Averaging, as an estimator of the expected runtime. The average runtime, that
   is the estimated expected runtime, is
   often plotted against dimension to indicate scaling with dimension. The 
   *arithmetic* average
   is only meaningful if the underlying distribution of the values
   is similar. Otherwise, the average of log-runtimes, or *geometric* average, 
   is useful. 
   
 - Restarts and simulated restarts, see Section :ref:`sec:Restarts`, do not 
   literally aggregate runtimes (which are literally defined only when |t| was
   hit).  They aggregate, however, time data to eventually supplement missing runtime
   values, see also [BBO2016perf]_.

General Code Structure
===============================================

The code basis of the COCO_ code consists of two parts. 

The *Experiments* part
  defines test suites, allows to conduct experiments, and provides the output
  data. The `code base is written in C`__, and wrapped in different languages
  (currently Java, Python, Matlab/Octave). An amalgamation technique is used
  that outputs two files ``coco.h`` and ``coco.c`` which suffice to run
  experiments within the COCO_ framework. 

  .. __: http://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/C


The *post-processing* part
  processes the data and displays the resulting runtimes. This part is
  entirely written in Python and heavily depends on |matplotlib|_ [HUN2007]_.  

.. |matplotlib| replace:: ``matplotlib``
.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/


Test Suites
=====================
Currently, the COCO_ framework provides three different test suites. 

``bbob`` 
  contains 24 functions in five subgroups [HAN2009fun]_.

``bbob-noisy``
  contains 30 noisy problems in three subgroups [HAN2009noi]_, 
  currently only implemented in the `old code basis`_.

``bbob-biobj``
  contains 55 bi-objective (:math:`m=2`) functions in 15 subgroups [BBO2016biobj]_.
