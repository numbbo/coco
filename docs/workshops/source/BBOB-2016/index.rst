==========================================================================================================================


Welcome to the web page of the upcoming Workshop on Real-Parameter Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB 2016)
with focus on multi-objective problems with two objective functions which is going to take place during GECCO 2016.

Quantifying and comparing the performance of optimization algorithms
is a difficult and tedious task to achieve. Previously, the Coco
platform has provided tools to ease this process for *single-objective
problems* by: (1) an implemented, well-motivated benchmark function
testbed, (2) a simple and sound experimental set-up, (3) the generation
of output data and (4) the post-processing and presentation of the
results in graphs and tables. For the first time, this year, we provide
an extension of the Coco platform towards a *multi-objective testbed*
(with two objective functions) and with nearly the same procedure as in
previous BBOB workshops.

The remaining tasks for participants are therefore: run your favorite
multi-objective black-box optimizer (old or new) by using the wrappers
provided and run the post-processing procedure (provided as well) that
will generate automatically all the material for a workshop paper
(LaTeX templates are provided). A description of the algorithm and the
discussion of the results completes the paper writing.

We encourage particularly submissions related to multi-objective algorithms
for *expensive optimization* (with a limited budget) and also *algorithms
from outside the evolutionary computation community*. Please note that
submissions related to the existing *single-objective BBOB testbeds*
(noiseless and noisy) are still welcome although the focus will be on
the new bi-objective testbed.

During the workshop, algorithms and results will be presented by
the participants. An overall analysis and comparison will be
accomplished by the organizers and the overall process will be
critically reviewed. A plenary discussion on future improvements will,
among others, address the question, of how the testbeds should evolve.


Updates and News
----------------
Get updated about the latest news regarding the workshop and
releases and bugfixes of the supporting NumBBO/Coco plateform, by
registering at http://numbbo.github.io/register.


Supporting material
-------------------
Most likely, you want to read the `Coco quick start <https://github.com/numbbo/coco>`_
(scroll down a bit). This page also provides the code for the benchmark functions, for running the
experiments in C, Java, Matlab, Octave, and Python, and for postprocessing the experiment data
into plots, tables, html pages, and LaTeX templates (LaTeX templates for the bi-objective test
suite will be provided soon).

The latest (hopefully) stable release of the Coco software can be downloaded as a whole
`here <https://github.com/numbbo/coco/releases/tag/v0.5-beta>`_.

Documentations of the functions used in the bbob-biobj suite for BBOB 2016 will be provided at
http://numbbo.github.io/bbob-biobj-functions-doc (currently under development).

Note that the current release of the new Coco platform does not contain the original noisy BBOB testbed,
such that you must use the old code at http://coco.gforge.inria.fr/doku.php?id=downloads for the time
being if you want to compare your algorithm on the noisy testbed.
