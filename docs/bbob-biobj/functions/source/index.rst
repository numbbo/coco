Introduction
============

In the following, we consider bi-objective, unconstrained
**minimization** problems of the form

.. math::
  \min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^D} f(x)=(f_\alpha(x),f_\beta(x)),

where :math:`D` is the number of variables of the problem (also called
the problem dimension), :math:`f_\alpha: \mathbb{R}^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}`
and :math:`f_\beta: \mathbb{R}^D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}` are the two
objective functions, and the :math:`\min` operator is related to the
standard *dominance relation*. A solution :math:`x\in\mathbb{R}^D`
is thereby said to *dominate* another solution :math:`y\in\mathbb{R}^D` if
:math:`f_\alpha(x) \leq f_\alpha(y)` and :math:`f_\beta(x) \leq f_\beta(y)` hold and at
least one of the inequalities is strict.

Solutions which are not dominated by any other solution in the search
space are called *Pareto-optimal* or *efficient solutions*. All
Pareto-optimal solutions constitute the *Pareto set* of which an 
approximation is sought. The Pareto set's image in the
objective space :math:`f(\mathbb{R}^D)` is called *Pareto front*.

The objective of the minimization problem is to find, with as few evaluations
of |f| as possible, a set of non-dominated solutions which is (i) as large
as possible and (ii) has |f|-values as close to the Pareto front as possible. 

.. Tea: I deleted the footnote because it introduced two concepts not explained yet (ideal and
   nadir points) and additionally brought in the issue of visibility of problem properties to algorithms, 
   which should be addressed elsewhere. Also, until we discuss the actual metric used (hypervolume), it makes
   no sense to go too deep into details here anyway.

.. |f| replace:: :math:`f`

Definitions and Terminology
---------------------------
We remind in this section different definitions.

*function instance, problem*
 Each function within COCO :math:`f_\theta: \mathbb{R}^D \to \mathbb{R}^m` is parametrized 
 with parameter values :math:`\theta \in \Theta`. A parameter value determines a so-called *function 
 instance*. For example, :math:`\theta` encodes the location of the optimum of single-objective functions, 
 which means that different instances have shifted optima. In the ``bbob-biobj`` 
 test suite, :math:`m=2` and the function instances are determined by the instances of the underlying
 single-objective functions. 
 
 A *problem* is a function instance of a specific dimension :math:`D`.

*ideal point*
 The ideal point is defined as the vector in objective space that
 contains the optimal |f|-value for each objective *independently*. 
 More precisely let :math:`f_\alpha^{\rm opt}:= \inf_{x\in \mathbb{R}^D} f_\alpha(x)` and
 :math:`f_\beta^{\rm opt}:= \inf_{x\in \mathbb{R}^D} f_\beta(x)`, the ideal point is given by
 
 .. math::
    :nowrap:

	\begin{equation*}
	z_{\rm ideal}  =  (f_\alpha^{\rm opt},f_\beta^{\rm opt}).
    \end{equation*}
    
 
*nadir point* 
 The *nadir point* (in objective space) consists in each objective of
 the worst value obtained by a Pareto-optimal solution. More precisely,
 let :math:`\mathcal{PO}` be the set of Pareto optimal points. Then the nadir point satisfies
 
 .. math::
    :nowrap:

	\begin{equation*}
	z_{\rm nadir}  =   \left( \sup_{x \in \mathcal{PO}} f_\alpha(x),
     \sup_{x \in \mathcal{PO}} f_\beta(x)  \right).
    \end{equation*} 
    
 In the case of two objectives with a unique global minimum each (that
 is, a single point in the search space maps to the global minimum) 
    
 .. math::
    :nowrap:

	\begin{equation*}
	z_{\rm nadir}  =   \left( f_\alpha(x_{\rm opt,\beta}),
      f_\beta(x_{\rm opt,\alpha})  \right),
    \end{equation*} 
    
   
 where :math:`x_{\rm opt,\alpha}= \arg \min f_\alpha(x)` and 
 :math:`x_{\rm opt,\beta}= \arg \min f_\beta(x)`.



Overview of the Proposed ``bbob-biobj`` Test Suite
==================================================

The ``bbob-biobj`` test suite provides 55 bi-objective functions in six
dimensions (2, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 40) with a large number of possible instances. 
The 55 functions are derived from combining a subset of the 24 well-known
single-objective functions of the ``bbob`` test suite [HAN2009fun]_ which
has been used since 2009 in the `BBOB workshop series
<http://numbbo.github.io/workshops/>`_ . While concrete details on each of
the 55 ``bbob-biobj`` functions are given in Section
:ref:`sec-test-functions`, we will detail here the main rationale behind
them together with their common properties.


The Single-objective ``bbob`` Functions
---------------------------------------
The ``bbob-biobj`` test suite is designed to be able to assess  performance of algorithms with respect to well-identified difficulties in optimization typically  occurring in real-world problems. A multi-objective problem being a combination of single-objective problems, one can obtain multi-objective problems with representative difficulties by simply combining single objective functions with representative difficulties observed in real-world problems. For this purpose we naturally use the single-objective ``bbob`` suite [HAN2009fun]_.

Combining all 24 ``bbob`` functions in pairs thereby results in
:math:`24^2=576` bi-objective functions overall. We however assume that
multi-objective optimization algorithms are not sensitive to permutations of
the objective functions such that combining the 24  ``bbob`` functions and
taking out the function :math:`(g_2,g_1)` if the function :math:`(g_1,g_2)`
is present results in :math:`24 + {24 \choose 2} = 24 + (24\times23)/2 = (24\times25)/2 = 300` functions.

.. Given that most (if not all) multi-objective optimization algorithms are
.. invariant to permutations of the objective functions, a bi-objective
.. function combining for example the sphere function as the first
.. objective with the Rastrigin function as the second objective will
.. result in the same performance than if the Rastrigin function is the
.. first and the sphere function is the second objective function. 
.. Hence, we should keep only one of the resulting
.. bi-objective functions. Combining then all 24 ``bbob`` functions

.. The first objective is chosen as ``bbob`` function *i*
  and the second as ``bbob`` function *j* with *i* :math:`\leq` *j*,
  resulting in :math:`24+ {24 \choose 2} = 300` functions.

Some first tests, e.g. in [BTH2015a]_, showed that having 300 functions is
impracticable in terms of the overall running time of the benchmarking
experiment.  We then decided to exploit the organization of the ``bbob``
functions into classes to choose a subset of functions. More precisely, the 24
original ``bbob`` functions are grouped into five function classes where each
class gathers functions with similar properties, namely

  1. separable functions
  2. functions with low or moderate conditioning
  3. functions with high conditioning and unimodal
  4. multi-modal functions with adequate global structure, 
  5. multi-modal functions with weak global structure.



To create the ``bbob-biobj`` suite, we choose two functions within each class. This way we do not introduce any bias towards a specific class. In addition within each class, the functions are chosen to be the most
representative without repeating similar functions. For example,
only one Ellipsoid, one Rastrigin, and one Gallagher function are
included in the ``bbob-biobj`` suite although they appear in
separate versions in the ``bbob`` suite. Finally our choice of  10 ``bbob`` functions for creating the ``bbob-biobj`` test suite is the following:

.. We chose two functions within each class
..  consider only the following 10 of the 24 ``bbob``
.. functions:


.. The above ten ``bbob`` functions have been chosen for the creation
.. of the ``bbob-biobj`` suite in a way to not introduce any bias
.. towards a specific class
.. by choosing exactly two functions per ``bbob`` function class.
.. Within each class, the functions were chosen to be the most
.. representative without repeating similar functions. For example,
.. only one Ellipsoid, one Rastrigin, and one Gallagher function are
.. included in the ``bbob-biobj`` suite although they appear in
.. separate versions in the ``bbob`` suite.

  - Schwefel x*sin(x) (function 20 in |bbob suite|_)
  - Gallagher 101 peaks (function 21 in |bbob suite|_)

  
Using the above described pairwise combinations, this results in
having :math:`10+{10 \choose 2} = 55` bi-objective functions in
the final `bbob-biobj` suite. These functions are denoted :math:`f_1` to :math:`f_{55}` in the sequel.

.. The next section gives the
.. reasoning behind choosing exactly these 10 functions.

  

Function Groups
---------------------------------------------------------------

From combining the original ``bbob`` function classes, we obtain 15 function classes to structure the 55 bi-objective functions of the ``bbob-biobj`` test suite. Each function class contains three or four functions. We are listing below the function classes and in parenthesis  the functions that belong to the respective class:
 1. separable - separable (functions :math:`f_1`, :math:`f_2`, :math:`f_{11}`)
 2. separable - moderate (:math:`f_3`, :math:`f_4`, :math:`f_{12}`, :math:`f_{13}`)
 3. separable - ill-conditioned (:math:`f_5`, :math:`f_6`, :math:`f_{14}`, :math:`f_{15}`)
 4. separable - multi-modal (:math:`f_7`, :math:`f_8`, :math:`f_{16}`, :math:`f_{17}`)
 5. separable - weakly-structured (:math:`f_9`, :math:`f_{10}`, :math:`f_{18}`, :math:`f_{19}`)
 6. moderate - moderate (:math:`f_{20}`, :math:`f_{21}`, :math:`f_{28}`)
 7. moderate - ill-conditioned (:math:`f_{22}`, :math:`f_{23}`, :math:`f_{29}`, :math:`f_{30}`)
 8. moderate - multi-modal (:math:`f_{24}`, :math:`f_{25}`, :math:`f_{31}`, :math:`f_{32}`)
 9. moderate - weakly-structured (:math:`f_{26}`, :math:`f_{27}`, :math:`f_{33}`, :math:`f_{34}`)
 10. ill-conditioned - ill-conditioned (:math:`f_{35}`, :math:`f_{36}`, :math:`f_{41}`)
 11. ill-conditioned - multi-modal (:math:`f_{37}`, :math:`f_{38}`, :math:`f_{42}`, :math:`f_{43}`)
 12. ill-conditioned - weakly-structured (:math:`f_{39}`, :math:`f_{40}`, :math:`f_{44}`, :math:`f_{45}`)
 13. multi-modal - multi-modal (:math:`f_{46}`, :math:`f_{47}`, :math:`f_{50}`)
 14. multi-modal - weakly structured (:math:`f_{48}`, :math:`f_{49}`, :math:`f_{51}`, :math:`f_{52}`)
 15. weakly structured - weakly structured (:math:`f_{53}`, :math:`f_{54}`, :math:`f_{55}`)


.. The original ``bbob`` function classes also allow to group the
.. 55 ``bbob-biobj`` functions, dependend on the
.. classes of the individual objective functions. Depending
.. on whether two functions of the same class are combined
.. or not, these resulting 15 new function classes contain three
.. or four functions:


More details about the single functions can be found in Section :ref:`sec-test-functions`. We however first describe their common properties in the coming sections.


Normalization of Objectives
------------------------------------
None of the 55 ``bbob-biobj`` functions is explicitly normalized and the
optimization algorithms therefore have to cope with objective values in
different ranges. Typically, different orders of magnitude
between the objective values can be observed.

However, to facilitate comparison of algorithm performance over different functions, 
we normalize the objectives based on the ideal and nadir points
before calculating the hypervolume indicator (see
`bbob-biobj-specific performance assessment documentation
<http://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/bbob-biobj/perf-assessment/>`_ for details).
Both points can be computed, because the global 
optimum is known and is unique for the 10 ``bbob`` base functions. 
In the black-box optimization benchmarking setup, however, the values of the
ideal and nadir points are not accessible to the optimization algorithm
[BBO2016ex]_.


.. TODO: this should become a reference
.. Dimo: don't know what you mean here, Niko

.. deleted: a normalization can take place as both the ideal and the nadir point are
   known internally. 

.. Note that, for example, the ``bbob-biobj`` observer of
.. the `Coco framework`_ takes this into account and normalizes the objective
.. space, see the `bbob-biobj-specific performance assessment documentation 
.. <http://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/bbob-biobj/perf-assessment/>`_ for
.. details.

.. deleted: The reasons for having knowledge about the location of both the ideal and
  the nadir point are
  * the definitions of the single-objective ``bbob`` test functions for 
  which the optimal function value and the optimal solution are known
  by design and
  * the fact that we explicitly chose only functions from the original
  ``bbob`` test suite which have a unique optimum.

.. deleted (this was a repetition from a previous section) 
   The ideal point is then always given by the objective 
   vector :math:`(f_\alpha(x_{\text{opt},\alpha}),
   f_\beta(x_{\text{opt},\beta}))` and the nadir point by the objective
   vector :math:`(f_\alpha(x_{\text{opt},\beta}),
   f_\beta(x_{\text{opt},\alpha}))` with :math:`x_{\text{opt},\alpha}` being
   the optimal solution for the first objective function :math:`f_\alpha` and
   :math:`x_{\text{opt},\beta}` being the optimal solution for the second
   objective function :math:`f_\beta`. Note that in the black-box case, we
   typically assume for the functions provided with the `Coco framework`_,
   that information about ideal and nadir points, scaling etc. is not
   provided to the algorithm.


Instances
---------
Our test functions are parametrized and instances are instantiations of the
underlying parameters (see [COCO:2016]_). The instances for the bi-objective
functions are using instances of each single objective function composing the
bi-objective one. In addition, we assert two conditions:

  1. The Euclidean distance between the two single-objective optima (also called the 
  extreme optimal points) in the search space is at least :math:`10^{-4}`. 

  2. The Euclidean distance between the ideal and the nadir point in the non-normalized 
  objective space is at least :math:`10^{-1}`. 
     
.. .. TODO:: fact-check this: is it really raw |f|-values? 
.. Dimo: this has been already checked in a discussion with Tea and Tobias

.. Instances are the way in the `Coco framework`_ to perform multiple
.. algorithm runs on the same function. More concretely, the original
.. Coco documentation states

.. ::

..  All functions can be instantiated in different *versions* (with
..  different location of the global optimum and different optimal
..  function value). Overall *Ntrial* runs are conducted on different
..  instantiations.

.. Also in the bi-objective case, we provide the idea of instances by
.. relying on the instances provided within the single-objective
.. ``bbob`` suite. 
.. However, in addition, we assert that


We associate to an instance, an instance-id which is an integer. The relation between the 
instance-id, :math:`K^{f}_{\rm id}`, of a bi-objective function :math:`f = (f_\alpha, f_\beta)`
and the instance-ids, :math:`K_{\rm id}^{f_\alpha}` and :math:`K_{\rm id}^{f_\beta}`, of its 
underlying single-objective functions :math:`f_\alpha` and :math:`f_\beta` is the following:

 * :math:`K_{\rm id}^{f_\alpha} = 2 K^{f}_{\rm id} + 1` and
 * :math:`K_{\rm id}^{f_\beta} = K_{\rm id}^{f_\alpha} + 1`


.. .. TODO:: should be :math:`2 K - 1` instead of :math:`2 K + 1`, no?
.. Dimo: no, the above and the examples below are correct (checked in code-experiments/src/suite_biobj.c, line 190)


If we find that above conditions are not satisfied for all dimensions and
functions in the ``bbob-biobj`` suite, we increase the instance-id of the
second objective successively until both properties are fulfilled. 
For example, the ``bbob-biobj`` instance-id
8 corresponds to the instance-id 17 for the first objective and instance-id 18 for
the second objective while for the ``bbob-biobj`` instance-id 9, the
first instance-id is 19 but for the second objective, instance-id 21 is chosen
instead of instance-id 20.

Exceptions to the above rule are, for historical reasons, the
``bbob-biobj`` instance-ids 1 and 2 in order to match the instance-ids
1 to 5 with the ones proposed in [BTH2015a]_. The ``bbob-biobj``
instance-id 1 contains the single-objective instance-ids 2 and 4 and
the ``bbob-biobj`` instance-id 2 contains the two instance-ids 3 and 5.

For each bi-objective function and given dimension, the ``bbob-biobj`` suite
contains 10 instances. 

.. Note that the number of instances from the ``bbob-biobj`` suite is
   neither limited from above nor from below. However, running some tests
   with less than 3 instances will render the potential statistics and
   their interpretation problematic while even the smallest difference can
   be made statistically significant with a high enough number of
   instances. Thus, we recommend to use between 5 to 15 instances for the actual
   benchmarking.
.. The user does not have a choice over the number of instances. 

.. Tea: At this point I'm missing some discussion on how in the bi-objective case instances 
   can affect more than just the "location of the optimum".

Some Function Properties
------------------------
In the description of the 55 ``bbob-biobj`` functions below, several
general properties of objective functions will be mentioned that
are defined here in short. It depends on these properties whether the optimization problem
is easy or hard to solve.

A *separable* function does not show any dependencies between the
variables and can therefore be solved by applying :math:`D` consecutive
one-dimensional optimizations along the coordinate axes while
keeping the other variables fixed. Consequently, *non-separable*
problems must be considered. They are much more difficult to solve. The
typical well-established technique to generate non-separable
functions from separable ones is the application of a rotation matrix
:math:`\mathbf R` to :math:`x`, that is :math:`x \in \mathbb{R}^D \mapsto g(\mathbf R x)`, 
where :math:`g` is a separable function. 

A *unimodal* function has only one local minimum which is at the same
time also its global one. 
A *multimodal* function has at least two local minima which is highly common
in practical optimization problems.

*Ill-conditioning* is another typical challenge in real-parameter
optimization and, besides multimodality, probably the most common one.
In a general case, we can consider a function as ill-conditioned if for
solution points from the same level-set "the minimal displacement [...] that 
produces a given function value improvement differs by
orders of magnitude" [HAN2011]_.
Conditioning can be rigorously formalized in the
case of convex quadratic functions,
:math:`f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x^THx` where :math:`H` is a symmetric
positive definite matrix, as the condition number of the Hessian matrix
:math:`H`. Since contour lines associated to a convex quadratic function
are ellipsoids, the condition number corresponds to the square root of
the ratio between the largest axis of the ellipsoid and the shortest axis.


The proposed ``bbob-biobj`` testbed contains ill-conditioned functions
with a typical conditioning of :math:`10^6`. We believe this is a realistic
requirement, while we have seen practical problems with conditioning
as large as :math:`10^{10}`.


Domain Bounds
-------------
All bi-objective functions provided in the ``bbob-biobj`` suite are unbounded, i.e., defined
on the entire real-valued space :math:`\mathbb{R}^D`. 
Nevertheless, they are designed such that the search domain of interest is :math:`[-5,5]^D`
and bound-constraint methods are likely to be competitive. [#]_

While we believe that this domain contains the Pareto set in most cases, due to the nature
of the ``bbob-biobj`` function definitions, there is no guarantee that this
is always the case --- it is only guaranteed that the extremal solutions and their
neighborhood ball of radius one lie within this region.

.. [#] The functions |coco_problem_get_smallest_value_of_interest|_ and 
  |coco_problem_get_largest_value_of_interest|_ 
  of the COCO_ platform allow the optimizer
  to retrieve the *search domain of interest* from the |coco_problem_t|_, 
  for example to generate the initial search points.

The 55 ``bbob-biobj`` Functions
-------------------------------

.. _f1:

:math:`f_1`: Sphere/Sphere
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of two sphere functions (|f`1` in the bbob suite|_).

Both objectives are unimodal, highly symmetric, rotational and scale
invariant. The Pareto set is known to be a straight line and the Pareto 
front is convex. Considered as the simplest bi-objective problem in
continuous domain.

Contained in the *separable - separable* function class.

.. * What is the optimal convergence rate of a bi-objective algorithm?


.. _f2:

:math:`f_2`: Sphere/Ellipsoid separable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of the sphere function (|f`1` in the bbob suite|_)
and the separable ellipsoid function (|f`2` in the bbob suite|_).

Both objectives are unimodal and separable. While the first objective is
truly convex-quadratic with a condition number of 1, the second
objective is only globally quadratic with smooth local
irregularities and highly ill-conditioned with a condition number of
about :math:`10^6`.

Contained in the *separable - separable* function class.


.. .. rubric:: Information gained from this function:

.. * In comparison to :math:`f_1`: Is symmetry exploited?


.. _f3:

:math:`f_3`: Sphere/Attractive sector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of the sphere function (|f`1` in the bbob suite|_)
and the attractive sector function (|f`6` in the bbob suite|_).

Both objective functions are unimodal, but only the first objective is
separable and truly convex quadratic. The attractive sector
function is highly asymmetric, where only one *hypercone* (with
angular base area) with a volume of roughly :math:`(1/2)^D`
yields low function values. The optimum of it is located at the tip
of this cone. 

Contained in the *separable - moderate* function class.

.. * In comparison to :math:`f_1` and :math:`f_{20}`:  What is the
  effect of a highly asymmetric landscape in both or one
  objective?


  
.. _f4:

:math:`f_4`: Sphere/Rosenbrock original
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of the sphere function (|f`1` in the bbob suite|_)
and the original, i.e., unrotated Rosenbrock function (|f`8` in the
bbob suite|_).

The first objective is separable and truly convex, the second
objective is partially separable (tri-band structure). The first
objective is unimodal while the second objective has a local
optimum with an attraction volume of about 25\%.

Contained in the *separable - moderate* function class.


.. .. rubric:: Information gained from this function:

.. * Can the search follow a long path with :math:`D-1` changes in
  the direction when it approaches one of the extremes of the
  Pareto front/Pareto set?





.. _f5:

:math:`f_5`: Sphere/Sharp ridge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of the sphere function (|f`1` in the bbob suite|_)
and the sharp ridge function (|f`13` in the bbob suite|_).

Both objective functions are unimodal.
In addition to the simple, separable, and differentiable first
objective, a sharp, i.e., non-differentiable ridge has to be
followed for optimizing the (non-separable) second objective. The
gradient towards the ridge remains constant, when the ridge is
approached from a given point.
Approaching the ridge is initially effective, but becomes ineffective
close to the ridge when the rigde needs to be followed in direction
to its optimum.  The necessary change in *search behavior* close to
the ridge is difficult to diagnose, because the gradient
towards the ridge does not flatten out.

Contained in the *separable - ill-conditioned* function class.


.. .. rubric:: Information gained from this function:

.. * Can the search continuously change its search direction when
  approaching one of the extremes of the Pareto front/Pareto set?
.. * What is the effect of having a non-smooth, non-differentiable
  function to optimize?


.. _f6:

:math:`f_6`: Sphere/Sum of different powers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of the sphere function (|f`1` in the bbob suite|_)
and the sum of different powers function (|f`14` in the bbob suite|_).

Both objective functions are unimodal. The first objective is
separable, the second non-separable.
When approaching the second objective's optimum, the difference 
in sensitivity between different directions in search space 
increases unboundedly. 

.. In addition, the second objective function
  possesses a small solution volume.


Contained in the *separable - ill-conditioned* function class.

:math:`f_7`: Sphere/Rastrigin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of the sphere function (|f`1` in the bbob suite|_)
and the Rastrigin function (|f`15` in the bbob suite|_).

In addition to the simple sphere function, the prototypical highly
multimodal Rastrigin function needs to be solved which has originally
a very regular and symmetric structure for the placement of the optima.
Here, however, transformations are performed to alleviate
the original symmetry and regularity in the second objective.

The properties of the second objective contain non-separabilty,
multimodality (roughly :math:`10^D` local optima), a conditioning of
about 10, and a large global amplitude compared to the local amplitudes.

Contained in the *separable - multi-modal* function class.


.. .. rubric:: Information gained from this function:

.. * With respect to fully unimodal functions: what is the effect of
  multimodality?

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of the sphere function (|f`1` in the bbob suite|_)
and the Schaffer F7 function with condition number 10 (|f`17` in
the bbob suite|_).

In addition to the simple sphere function, an asymmetric, non-separable,
and highly multimodal function needs to be solved to approach the Pareto
front/Pareto set where the frequency and amplitude of the modulation
in the second objective vary. The conditioning of the second objective
and thus the entire bi-objective function is low.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of the sphere function (|f`1` in the bbob suite|_)
and the Schwefel function (|f`20` in the bbob suite|_).

While the first objective function is separable and unimodal,
the second objective function is partially separable and highly
multimodal---having the most prominent :math:`2^D` minima located
comparatively close to the corners of the unpenalized search area. 

Contained in the *separable - weakly-structured* function class.


.. .. rubric:: Information gained from this function:

.. * In comparison to e.g. :math:`f_8`: What is the effect of a weak
  global structure?

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of the sphere function (|f`1` in the bbob suite|_)
and the Gallagher function with 101 peaks (|f`21` in the bbob
suite|_).

While the first objective function is separable and unimodal,
the second objective function is non-separable and consists
of 101 optima with position and height being unrelated and
randomly chosen (different for each instantiation of the function).

objective function is about 30.

quadratic with smooth local irregularities, and highly
ill-conditioned with a condition number of
about :math:`10^6`.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Combination of the separable ellipsoid function (|f`2` in the bbob suite|_) 
and the attractive sector function (|f`6` in the bbob suite|_).

Both objective functions are unimodal but only the first
one is separable. The first objective function, in addition,
is globally quadratic with smooth local irregularities, and

separable.

The first objective is globally quadratic but with smooth local
irregularities and highly ill-conditioned with a condition number of
about :math:`10^6`. For optimizing the second objective, a sharp,
i.e., non-differentiable ridge has to be followed.
