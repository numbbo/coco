bbob_pproc package random thoughts:
04/2012: the tables in many algorithm papers should not have a targets line for each function. 
   To accomplish this, the argument function_targets_line in compall/pptables.main needs to 
   be put in action (and tested).  
04/2012: compall/pptables.py contains reference pointers which are the likely reason for
  mis-referring the (1+1)-CMA-ES from 2010 to the paper of 2009. 
04/2012: problem: 3 different names for one algorithm in one report: 
  specifically, a problem is the legend in compall/ppfigs.py, 
  which takes invariably the folder name as algorithm name, see Petrs Mail from March 26
04/2012: maxfevals should occur in Figure 1 also when comparing algorithms (compall/ppfigs.py)
03/2012: The datasets in the svn for noisy and noiseless data should be separated
03/2012: processInputArgs and findfiles should accept zipped folders
    import zipfile
    def extract(zipfilepath, extractiondir):
        zip = zipfile.ZipFile(zipfilepath)
        zip.extractall(path=extractiondir)  # cave security extracting ../../../../something
02/2012: the oracle best algorithm must inherit pproc.DataSet object, 
  just as the portfolio in algportfolio.py does. Check out the portfolio code
  for an implementation. See also next item!
02/2012: changing class pproc.DataSet to class pproc.DataSet(object) produces an error!
  This should be addressed before the oracle algorithm is implemented. 

__init__.py: what for? Looks like a package documentation and is supposed to 
  define all visible modules in the package. 
run.py: main interface? is unfortunately rungeneric.py (and all over the documentation)
post-processing raw data: how? make it clear(er) 
Feature missing: output data that is human readable. A: use HDF5? 
documentation
web: unify, clean up
class DataSet: makes sense, what attributes and methods? A: seems well documented. 
class DataSetList: does it make sense? sort per problem
dictAlg: what is this? Probably a dictionary of datasetlists with algorithm names as keys. 

make it easier to work from the python command-line: operations such as loading and generating figures...

different outputs: have to work with a template
1 alg:
ppfigdim: scaling figures, show ERT for different target vs dim for one algorithm
pptable: table of bootstrap distribution of ERT for numerous functions and different dimensions
ppecdf: ec distribution of run lengths for reaching different targets and also ecdf of function values
pplos: figure and table of ERT log loss for given budgets

2 algs:
ppfig2: ert ratios over target function values
pptable2: ert for different target function values
ppscatter: scatter plot ERT1 vs ERT0
ppecdf2: superposition of ECD of run lengths for given target function values

more algs:
ppfigs: bootstrap distribution of ert over multiple targets
pptables: bootstrap distribution ert over multiple targets

targets -> ERT
targets -> bootstrap distribution of ERT
targets -> run lengths
budget -> targets -> ERT


TODO:
*provide individual performance tables on the web with (a) fixed targets and (b) run-length-based targets using 1e-8 as last additional target row
*Do higher dim benchmark functions
*Real-world functions
*Test some other algorithms
*Availability in other languages...
*Interpretation of time complexity of the algorithms
*Documentation for the comparison
*Web server for the execution of the code (could be the experiments or the post-processing...)

Rehaul v4:
*clearer code (esp. the comparison)
*template-independent code...

Rehaul v4 (old):
*data structure (to be discussed):
**falignx, faligndata, evalignx, evaligndata, mFEs, finalfs... NaN in the end...
  evals,               funvals,               maxevals, finalfunvals
*Have a data structure by problem (a problem being in our case a function, a dimension but could be anything really).
**ASCII File representation of DataSet

Error catching:
*IOError with pickled data. -> dealt with?

Feature missing:
*Check that the given target function values are dictionaries?
*is the raw data provided compatible with bbob_pproc? -> simply try and run the main of bbob_pproc?
*Java application on the web
*template-independent stuff...
*in the RLD figures, if some final values are 0 there is the chance that the
line for Df/ftarget = 1 to the first final value for which it is larger than 1
is missing.
*Automatically generate the associated TeX file to compile...
*rewrite the ppXXX with common script in pproc...
*put in pproc methods to determine success and failure so as to have uniform
data for all ppXXX modules.
*have low-level post-processing functions that deals with arrays.
*Deal with archive file -> no file-like object for zipfile module in python 2.5.2
*Compute the Crafting Effort based on the comment line in the info file?
*Readable output instead of pickle files?

Misc.
*Problem with some fonts missing for tex compilation.
*Explicit demo post processing.
*Update the readme from the demo folder.

Profiling:


###############################################################################
SOLVED:
*Provide a clean doc page that is helpful and useful -> pydoc.writedocs('.') in BBOB/code/python
*Think about adding bbob.bib to the release.
*Put the pydoc online.
*Manage multiple algorithms
*diagnose that all the trials (3) for all instance id (1..5) are there -> added instanceOfInterest and warning in run.py.
*Write somewhere the result of the discussion about maxEvals.
*does the maxEvalsFactor appearing in ppfigdim still makes sense? -> It does not. It's been removed
*Make sure that anyone could produce a fig, table or data profile for every dimensions, functions they want.
*Problem with some negative values on f-fopt on function 5!!! -> the post processing does not crash on negative values anymore.
*When given a wrong path, nothing happens...
*maxEvalsFactor appears in pptex and pprldistr and ppfig and have to be synchronized -> only appear in ppfigdim now.
*Deal with data with more than one algId -> warning
*Problem with maxEvalsFactor in pprldistr: if maxEvalsFactor is not set alright, there is a good chance one of the final value distribution graph for maxEvalsF = 10^i*D will overlap one of the graph where Deltaf changes.
*warning: no labels for legend
*Put a latex macro in the template to input the path to the external files.
*Play with the fontsize (smaller titles, larger ticks).
*Update experimentation.tex
*New tex table format:
  Df # ERT 10% 90% Tus
  Df 0 median_f 10%f 90%f Tus
*Have SP1 on the data profile graph as well? -> not needed
*synchronize the caption of the data profiles with information from the post processing? -> legend
*Put a separation line in the table between function evaluations and function values -> Not needed
*Have the number of solved functions appear on the data profile graph
*Prepare for vertical aligning!
*make tab-only faster: it doesn't need to process everything...
*final function value distribution.
*generate data for the run length distrib figure, ppfig and pptex not in pproc (to make pprldistr pptex and ppfig modules self-consistent)
*sign missing for function values in the tables!
*PprocIndexEntry class to be implemented -> IndexEntry
*Change mention of data profile graph to run length graph.
*Caption of the tables is too large!
*max. FEvals appearing in the tables is not the one set for the experiment but
an empirical value (measured). -> OK.
*Move the figures and make them larger. -> thx Niko
*test runs with CMA-ES: -> Bug solved!
**only if the target function value is negative, successful runs are actually treated as successful
**the graphs seem to go wrong when fopt is positive, see attached pdf, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6
**another problem is in the tables, as already f_t is not reported properly
*Documentation: import pydoc, pydoc.writedoc(module_of_choice) -> pydoc.writedocs('.','') in BBOB/code/python
*Short titles for the figures
*Problem with reading the data: the last line was left unread
*Problem with the median that was defined though it was not.
*Problem with Gtk/gdk over ssh (import matplotlib) -> ssh -X
*delete tex before writing in at the launch of the post processing... are the files written in again? -> They are not so the output tex files are simply overwritten.
*last figures: not spanned over the width of the page -> put a tabular.
*increased font size for figure -> parameter in __init__.py
*Change ticks labels font size -> parameter in __init__.py
*Visible Symbol for the last function value reached -> Make more visible?
*F_t in the tables instead of f_t (cf experimentation.pdf §6.4)
*BUG: demo.py when the toydata folder does not exist -> catch when args is empty.
*function values in italics missing -> pproc.py has to return in arrayTab the right things.
*Problem with demo (is not working): no possibility of shorter demo due to writeTable2. It should try and take as input a list of arrays.
*computevalues: rename and make some varargin -> not used anymore
