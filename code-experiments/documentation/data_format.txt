This file specifies the different COCO data formats produced by the experiment code (i.e. written by a logger) and 
read in by the post processing part of COCO.

General remarks:
  - all data of each COCO experiment are written into a single folder into human-readable .info and .dat files with potential further .tdat and .rdat files and additional subfolders
  - the .info files are summary files and serve as the index files to the actual raw data files (.dat, .tdat, etc.)
  - the actual raw data, used in the postprocessing is contained in the .dat files, indexed by the .info files
  - comments are done by `%`

Index files (*.info):
1st line (note that starred entries might be omitted in older
data sets and are then inferred from the data):
  - single objective case:
    suite name (e.g. suite = 'bbob')*, 
    function identifier (funcId = 1), 
    search space dimension (DIM = 2), 
    precision to reach (Precision = 1.000e-08), 
    algorithm identifier (algId = 'random_search'), 
    logger name (logger = 'bbob')*, 
    data format (data_format = 'bbob')*, 
    software version (coco_version = '2.0.507')*
  - bi-objective case:
    suite name (e.g. suite = 'bbob-biobj')*, 
    algorithm identifier (algorithm = 'RS-100'), 
    indicator identifier (indicator = 'hyp'), 
    relative location of data files (folder = '1-separable_1-separable'), 
    logger name (logger = 'bbob-biobj')*, 
    data format (data_format = 'bbob-biobj')*, 
    software version (coco_version = '2.0.507')*
2nd line: comments of the user (e.g. important parameter or used internal methods)
3rd line (and all succeeding ones):
  - single objective case:
    relative location and name of data file(s) (e.g. data_f1/bbobexp_f1_DIM2_i1.dat),
    information on a single run (can be repeated multiple times, separated by commata):
      the instance of the test function,
      a colon,
      final number of function evaluations, 
      a vertical bar,
      the final best function value minus target function value (e.g. 1:41|3.5e-01).
  - bi-objective case:
    function identifier (function =  2), 
    search space dimension (dim = 2), 
    name of data file(s) (e.g. bbob-biobj_f02_d02_hyp.dat), 
    information on a single run (can be repeated multiple times, separated by commata):
      the instance of the test function,
      a colon,
      final number of function evaluations, 
      a vertical bar,
      the final best function value minus target function value (e.g. 1:41|3.5e-01).

All entries in the 1st, 3rd and all succeeding lines are separated by commas. The 1st line 
should be a valid Python code when surrounded like "dict(" + line + ")".


Data files (*.dat, *.tdat, *.adat):
Data files contain one or more runs, all of them for the same function and dimension. 
At the start of each run the header is written. 
The post-processing checks the header for the following information:
  - instance: the current instance number
  - reference value of the hypervolume indicator (bi-objective case)
  - algorithm type: if this value is set to 'best' then this is an artifical best 
    algorithm data.  
After the header each line represents one evaluation. You can see what each column 
represents in the last line of the header. 

If the final number of function evaluations (for a specific function, dimension 
and instance) in the info file does not match the last evaluation number in tdat 
file then a warning is issued: "There is a difference between the maxevals in the 
*.info file and in the data files." 

What columns represent is defined (at least for the relevant columns) by the data format 
specified in the info file.

The data format field in the info file specifies which columns in the dat file contain 
relevant information for the post-processing in order to be able to read in the data correctly.

Possible values for data format field:
1. "bbob" contracted (for single objective problems):
  - 1st column: evaluation number
  - 3rd column: function value
  - informal:
    - 2nd column: current function value
    - number of target function values for each decade = 5
2. "bbob-biobj" contracted (bi-objective problems):
  - 1st column: evaluation number
  - 2nd column: indicator value
  - informal:
    - number of target function values for each decade = 10
3. "bbob-constrained" (single objective constrained problems):
  - 1st column: f evaluation number
  - 2nd column: g evaluation number
  - 3rd column: function value
  - informal:
    - number of target function values for each decade = 5
    
TODO: What to change in the post-processing if you add a new data-format?
 
Possible values for suite name field:
1. "bbob" results in using GECCOBBOBTestbed class in post-processing
2. "bbob-noisy" results in using GECCOBBOBNoisyTestbed class in post-processing  
3. "bbob-biobj" results in using GECCOBiObjBBOBTestbed class in post-processing
4. "bbob-constrained" results in using CONSBBOBTestbed class in post-processing
