% This script runs random search for BUDGET_MULTIPLIER*DIM function
% evaluations on a COCO suite and can serve also as a timing experiment.
%
% This example experiment allows also for easy implementation of independent
% restarts by simply increasing NUM_OF_INDEPENDENT_RESTARTS. To make this
% effective, the algorithm should have at least one more stopping criterion
% than just a maximal budget.
%
more off; % to get immediate output in Octave

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Experiment Parameters %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
BUDGET_MULTIPLIER = 2; % algorithm runs for BUDGET_MULTIPLIER*dimension funevals
NUM_OF_INDEPENDENT_RESTARTS = 1e9; % max. number of independent algorithm
% restarts; if >0, make sure that the
% algorithm is not always doing the same thing
% in each run (which is typically trivial for
% randomized algorithms)

% bbob-biobj-ext    92 unconstrained noiseless bi-objective functions
