    In the example, an observer was added to produce output data for the

    on random search:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from cocoex import Suite, Observer

    We can select a single function, say BBOB f9 in 20D, of a given suite like:

    >>> import cocoex as ex
    >>> suite = ex.Suite("bbob", "", "dimensions:20 instance_indices:1")
    >>> len(suite)
    24
    >>> f9 = suite.get_problem(8)
    >>> x = f9.initial_solution  # a copy of a feasible point
    >>> all(x == 0)
    True

    See module attribute `cocoex.known_suite_names` for known suite names:

    >>> import cocoex as ex
    >>> for suite_name in ex.known_suite_names:
    ...     suite = ex.Suite(suite_name, "", "")
    ...     print(suite.dimensions)
    ...     for f in suite:

    ...         # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    [2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40]...

    See file `example_experiment.py` for a full example use case.

    Details: depending on the benchmark suite and observer, only one problem can
    be open at a time. Using `get_problem` without `free` or mixing the use of
    `next_problem` and `get_problem` may not be possible. For example, in this
    case the "bbob" observer is known to lead to a crash of the Python
    interpreter.
