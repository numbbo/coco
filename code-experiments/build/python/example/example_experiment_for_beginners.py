"""A short and simple example experiment with restarts.

The code is fully functional but mainly emphasises on readability.
Hence produces only rudimentary progress messages and does not provide
batch distribution or timing prints, as `example_experiment2.py` does.

To apply the code to a different solver, `fmin` must be re-assigned or
re-defined accordingly. For example, using `cma.fmin` instead of
`scipy.optimize.fmin` can be done like::

    import cma
    def fmin(fun, x0, **kwargs):
        return cma.fmin2(fun, x0, 2, {'verbose': -9} if not kwargs.get('disp')
                                     else None)[0]
