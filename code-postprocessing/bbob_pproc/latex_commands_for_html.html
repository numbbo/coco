Bootstrapped empirical cumulative distribution of the number of objective function evaluations divided by dimension (FEvals/DIM) for all functions and subgroups in DIMVALUE-D. The targets are chosen from BBOBPPFIGSTARGETRANGE such that the REFERENCEALGORITHM artificial algorithm just not reached them within a given budget of k &times; DIM, with k &#8712; {0.5, 1.2, 3, 10, 50}. The "best 2009" line corresponds to the best <span class="roman">aRT</span>&nbsp;observed during BBOB 2009 for each selected target.
