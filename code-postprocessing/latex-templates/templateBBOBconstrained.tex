%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% note that the following text is just a proposal and can/should be changed to your needs:
In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the \change{\algorithmA} with restarts on the entire \bbobcons test suite \cite{dufosse2022constrained} for $2 D$ function evaluations according to \cite{hansen2016exp}. The \change{C/Java/Matlab/Octave/Python} code was run on a \change{Mac Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400S CPU @ 2.50GHz} with \change{1} processor and \change{4} cores \change{and (compile) options xxx}. The time per function evaluation for dimensions 2, 3, 5, 10, 20\change{, 40} equals \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$xx$}, \change{$xxx$}\change{, and $xxx$} seconds respectively.

The experiments were performed with COCO \cite{hansen2020cocoplat}, version
\change{\version}, the plots were produced with version \change{\version}.

The \textbf{expected runtime (ERT)}, used in the figures and tables,
depends on a given target value, $\fgtarget=\fopt+\Dfg$, and the merit
function

$$
\tilde{f}(x) := \max(f_{\text{opt}}, f(x))
+ \sum_{k=0}^{m} \max(0, g_k(x))
$$
with $\fopt = f(x_{\text{opt}})$ (and $\min{\tilde{f}} = \fopt$).
The ERT is computed over all relevant trials as the sum of
function and constraint evaluations executed during each trial
while the best value of the merit function stays above \fgtarget,
summed over all trials and divided by the
number of trials that actually reached \fgtarget\
\cite{dufosse2022constrained,hansen2012exp,price1997dev}. 
\textbf{Statistical significance} is tested with the rank-sum test for a given
target $\fgtarget$ using, for each trial,
either the number of needed function and constraints evaluations to reach
$\fgtarget$ (inverted and multiplied by $-1$), or, if the target
was not reached, the best $\Dfg$-value achieved, measured only up to
the smallest number of overall (function $+$ constraints) evaluations for any
unsuccessful trial under consideration.
