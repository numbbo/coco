\section{CPU Timing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% note that the following text is just a proposal and can/should be changed to your needs:
In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the \change{\algorithmA} with restarts on the entire \bbobcons test suite \cite{dufosse2022constrained} for $2 D$ function evaluations according to \cite{hansen2016exp}. The \change{C/Java/Matlab/Octave/Python} code was run on a \change{Mac Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400S CPU @ 2.50GHz} with \change{1} processor and \change{4} cores \change{and (compile) options xxx}. The time per function evaluation for dimensions 2, 3, 5, 10, 20\change{, 40} equals \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$xx$}, \change{$xxx$}\change{, and $xxx$} seconds respectively.

The experiments were performed with COCO \cite{hansen2020cocoplat}, version
\change{\version}, the plots were produced with version \change{\version}.

The \textbf{expected runtime (ERT)}, used in the figures and tables,
depends on a given target value, $\fgtarget=\fopt+\Dfg$, and is
computed over all relevant trials as the sum of function and constraint
evaluations executed during each trial while the best value of $TODO{ftodo}$
did not reach \fgtarget, summed over all trials and divided by the
number of trials that actually reached \fgtarget\
\cite{dufosse2022constrained,hansen2012exp,price1997dev}. 
\textbf{Statistical significance} is tested with the rank-sum test for a given
target $\Delta\fgtarget$ using, for each trial,
either the number of needed function and constraints evaluations to reach
$\Delta\fgtarget$ (inverted and multiplied by $-1$), or, if the target
was not reached, the best $\Dfg$-value achieved, measured only up to
the smallest number of overall (function $+$ constraints) evaluations for any
unsuccessful trial under consideration.
