%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\section{CPU Timing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% note that the following text is just a proposal and can/should be changed to your needs:
In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the \change{MY-ALGORITHM-NAME} on the  \change{bbob test suite \cite{hansen2009fun}} with restarts for a maximum budget equal to \change{$400 (D + 2)$} function evaluations. The code was run on a \change{Mac Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400S CPU @ 2.50GHz} with \change{1} processor and \change{4} cores. The time per function evaluation for dimensions 20, 40, 80, 160, 320\change{, 640} equals \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$xx$}, \change{$xxx$}\change{, and $xxx$} seconds respectively. 

\change{repeat the above for any algorithm tested}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Results from experiments according to \cite{hansen2016exp} and \cite{hansen2016perfass} on the
benchmark functions given in \cite{wp200901_2010,hansen2012fun} are
presented in Figures~\ref{fig:scaling}, \ref{fig:ECDFs05D} and
\ref{fig:ECDFs320D} and in Tables~\ref{tab:aRTs5} and~\ref{tab:aRTs20}.
The experiments were performed with COCO \cite{hansen2016cocoplat}, version
\change{1.0.1}, the plots were produced with version \change{1.0.4}.

The \textbf{average runtime (aRT)}, used in the figures and tables,
depends on a given target function value, $\ftarget=\fopt+\Df$, and is
computed over all relevant trials as the number of function
evaluations executed during each trial while the best function value
did not reach \ftarget, summed over all trials and divided by the
number of trials that actually reached \ftarget\
\cite{hansen2012exp,price1997dev}.  \textbf{Statistical significance}
is tested with the rank-sum test for a given target $\Delta\ftarget$
%($10^{-8}$ as in Figure~\ref{fig:scaling})
using, for each trial,
either the number of needed function evaluations to reach
$\Delta\ftarget$ (inverted and multiplied by $-1$), or, if the target
was not reached, the best $\Df$-value achieved, measured only up to
the smallest number of overall function evaluations for any
unsuccessful trial under consideration.
