%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{CPU Timing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% note that the following text is just a proposal and can/should be changed to your needs:
In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the \change{\algorithmA} with restarts on the entire bbob-biobj test suite \cite{biobj2022func} for $2 D$ function evaluations according to \cite{hansen2016exp}. The \change{C/Java/Matlab/Octave/Python} code was run on a \change{Mac Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400S CPU @ 2.50GHz} with \change{1} processor and \change{4} cores \change{and (compile) options xxx}. The time per function evaluation for dimensions 2, 3, 5, 10, 20\change{, 40} equals \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$xx$}, \change{$xxx$}\change{, and $xxx$} seconds respectively. 

\change{repeat the above for any algorithm tested}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Results from experiments according to \cite{hansen2016exp} and
\cite{hansen2022anytime} on the benchmark
functions given in \cite{biobj2022func} are presented in
Figures~\ref{fig:ECDFsingleOne}, \ref{fig:ECDFsingleTwo}, \ref{fig:ECDFsGroupsFive} and
\ref{fig:ECDFsGroupsTwenty} and in Tables~\ref{tab:ERTs5} and~\ref{tab:ERTs20}.
The experiments were performed with COCO \cite{hansen2020cocoplat}, version
\change{\version}, the plots were produced with version \change{\version}.

The \textbf{expected runtime (ERT)}, used in the %figures and
tables,
depends on a given quality indicator value, $\Itarget=\hvref+\DI$, and is
computed over all relevant trials as the number of function
evaluations executed during each trial while the best indicator value
did not reach \Itarget, summed over all trials and divided by the
number of trials that actually reached \Itarget\
\cite{hansen2022anytime,price1997dev}.  \textbf{Statistical significance}
is tested with the rank-sum test for a given target $\Itarget$
using, for each trial,
either the number of needed function evaluations to reach
$\Itarget$ (inverted and multiplied by $-1$), or, if the target
was not reached, the best $\DI$-value achieved, measured only up to
the smallest number of overall function evaluations for any
unsuccessful trial under consideration.
