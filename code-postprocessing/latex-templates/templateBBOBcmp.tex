\section{CPU Timing}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% note that the following text is just a proposal and can/should be changed to your needs:
In order to evaluate the CPU timing of the algorithm, we have run the \change{MY-ALGORITHM-NAME} on the  \change{bbob test suite \cite{hansen2010fun}} with restarts for a maximum budget equal to \change{$400 (D + 2)$} function evaluations according to \cite{hansen2016exp}. The \change{C/Java/Python/Matlab/Octave} code was run on a \change{Mac Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2400S CPU @ 2.50GHz} with \change{1} processor and \change{4} cores \change{and (compile) options xxx}. The time per function evaluation for dimensions 2, 3, 5, 10, 20\change{, 40} equals \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$x.x$}, \change{$xx$}, \change{$xxx$}\change{, and $xxx$} seconds respectively. 

\change{repeat the above for the second algorithm}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Results from experiments according to \cite{hansen2016exp} and \cite{hansen2016perfass} on the benchmark
functions given in \cite{wp200901_2010,hansen2010fun} are presented in
Figures~\ref{fig:scaling}, \ref{fig:scatterplots} and \ref{fig:RLDs} and
in Table~\ref{tab:aRTs}. The experiments were performed with COCO \cite{hansen2016cocoplat},
version \change{2.0}, the plots were produced with version \change{2.0}.

The \textbf{average runtime (aRT)}, used in the figures and table, depends on a
given target function value, $\ftarget=\fopt+\Df$, and is computed over all relevant trials
as the number of function evaluations executed during each trial while the best
function value did not reach \ftarget, summed over all trials
and divided by the number of trials that actually reached \ftarget\
\cite{hansen2010exp,price1997dev}.
\textbf{Statistical significance} is tested with the rank-sum test for a given
target $\Delta\ftarget$ ($10^{-8}$ as in Figure~\ref{fig:scaling}) using,
for each trial, either the number of needed function evaluations to reach
$\Delta\ftarget$ (inverted and multiplied by $-1$), or, if the target was not
reached, the best $\Df$-value achieved, measured only up to the smallest number
of overall function evaluations for any unsuccessful trial under consideration.
