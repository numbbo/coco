The targets are chosen from !!TARGET-RANGES-IN-ECDF!! such that !!THE-REF-ALG!! just not reached them within a given budget of k &times; DIM, with !!NUM&#8722;OF&#8722;TARGETS&#8722;IN&#8722;ECDF!! different values of k chosen equidistant in logscale within the interval {0.5, ..., 50}.

        grid lines depict quadratic scaling.

        Entries, succeeded by a star, are statistically significantly better (according to
        the rank-sum test) when compared to all other algorithms of the table, with
        p = 0.05 or p = 10<sup>&#8722;k</sup> when the number k following the star is larger
        than 1, with Bonferroni correction by the number of functions (24). Best results are printed in bold.

        <span class="roman">ERT</span>&nbsp;loss ratio versus the budget in number of f-evaluations
        divided by dimension.
        For each given budget <span class="roman">FEvals</span>, the target value f<sub><span class="roman">t</span></sub>&nbsp;is computed
        as the best target f-value reached within the
        budget by the given algorithm.
        Shown is then the <span class="roman">ERT</span>&nbsp;to reach f<sub><span class="roman">t</span></sub>&nbsp;for the given algorithm
        or the budget, if 
        reached a better target within the budget,
        divided by the <span class="roman">ERT</span>&nbsp;of  to reach f<sub><span class="roman">t</span></sub>.

        (box), 10-90%-ile (caps), and minimum and maximum <span class="roman">ERT</span>&nbsp;loss ratio
        (points). The vertical line gives the maximal number of function evaluations
        in a single trial in this function subset. See also
