[This code](https://github.com/numbbo/coco) provides a platform to
benchmark and compare continuous optimizers, AKA non-linear solvers
for numerical optimization. It is fully written in `ANSI C` and
`Python` (reimplementing the original Comparing Continous
Optimizer platform) with other languages calling the `C` code.
Languages currently available to connect a solver to the benchmarks are

  - `C/C++`
  - `Java`
  - `MATLAB/Octave`
  - `Python`
  - `Rust`

Code for others might be available in branched code.
Contributions to link further languages (including a better
example in `C++`) are more than welcome.

The general project structure is shown in the following figure
where the black color indicates code or data provided by the platform
and the red color indicates either user code or data and graphical output
from using the platform:

Requirements  <a name="Requirements"></a>
------------
1. For a machine running experiments 
  - A `C` compiler, such as gcc
  - Python >=3.6 with `setuptools` installed
  - optional: `git`
2. For a machine displaying data by running the post-processing
  - Python 3 with `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, and `six` installed.
    We recommend installing the [Anaconda Python library](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

For Ubuntu 16.04+, all the requirements can be installed using the following command:

```
apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-numpy python-matplotlib \
                python-scipy python-six python-setuptools
```

For macOS, the `C` compiler comes with installing the Xcode command line tools like

```
xcode-select install
```

### Windows Specifics
Under Windows, two alternative compile toolchains can be used: 

1. [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/) which comes with gcc and make, available in 32- and 64-bit versions.  
2. MinGW's gcc (http://www.mingw.org/ for 32-bit or https://mingw-w64.org for 64-bit machines). Make sure to update the Windows path to MinGW's make.exe and rename/link the gcc.exe to cc.exe.

For using `git` under Windows (optional), we recommend installing [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/).

### Programming Language Specifics  <a name="Language-Specifics"></a>
_Additional_ requirements for running an algorithm in a specific language.

* **C**: `make`, such as GNU make (when using [GNU make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm), make sure that your ``CC`` environment variable is set to `gcc` by potentially typing `set CC=gcc` if you see an error). 
* **Java**: `gcc` and any Java Development Kit (JDK), such that `javac` and `javah` are accessible 
  (i.e. in the system path).
* **Rust**: For details, take a look at the [Rust Readme](./code-experiments/build/rust/README.md)
* **MATLAB**: at least MATLAB 2008, for details, see [here](./code-experiments/build/matlab/README.md)
* **Python**:
  * **new**: requires only to be able to install `coco-experiment` and `cocopp`
  * **was**:
    * **Python on Windows with MinGW**: Python 2.7 and the Microsoft compiler package for Python 2.7 
    containing VC9, available [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266). 
    These are necessary to build the C extensions for the Python `cocoex` module for Windows. 
    The package contains 32-bit and 64-bit compilers and the Windows SDK headers.
    * **Python on Linux**: `python-dev` must be installed to compile/install the `cocoex` module.
* **Octave**: Octave 4.0.0 or later. On operating systems other than Windows, earlier versions might work.
  Under Linux the package `liboctave-dev` might be necessary. 

### Guaranties (None)
We tested the framework on Mac OSX, Ubuntu linux, Fedora linux, and Windows (XP,
7, 10) in various combinations of 32-bit and 64-bit compilers, python versions
etc. Naturally, we cannot guarantee that the framework runs on any combination
of operating system and software installed. In case you experience some incompatibilies,
check out the [_Known Issues / Trouble Shooting_ Section](#Known-Issues) below. 
Otherwise we will be happy if you can document them in detail on the 
[issue tracker](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/issues). 


Getting Started <a name="Getting-Started"></a>
---------------
0. Check out the [_Requirements_](#Requirements) above.

1. Install the post-processing for **displaying** data (using Python):

    ```
        pip install cocopp
    ```

    As long as no experiments are meant to be run, the next points 2.-6. can be skipped and continue with points 7. and 8. below.

1. For running experiments **in Python**, follow the (new) instructions [here](https://numbbo.it/getting-started/experiment-python.html).
   **Otherwise, download** the COCO framework code from github,
    - either by clicking the [Download ZIP button](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/archive/master.zip) 
      and unzip the `zip` file, 
    - or by typing `git clone https://github.com/numbbo/coco.git`. This way 
      allows to remain up-to-date easily (but needs `git` to be installed). After 
      cloning, `git pull` keeps the code up-to-date with the latest release. 

    The record of official releases can 
    be found [here](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/releases). The latest release corresponds 
    to the [master branch](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/tree/master) as linked above. 

3. In a system shell, **`cd` into** the `coco` or `coco-<version>` folder (framework root), 
    where the file `do.py` can be found. Type, i.e. **execute**, one of the following commands once
    ```sh
      python do.py run-c
      python do.py run-java
      python do.py run-matlab
      python do.py run-octave
      python do.py run-python
    ```  
    depending on which language shall be used to run the experiments. `run-*` will build the 
    respective code and run the example experiment once. The build result and the example
    experiment code can be found under `code-experiments/build/<language>` (`<language>=matlab` 
    for Octave). `python do.py` lists all available commands. 
  
4. **Copy** the folder `code-experiments/build/YOUR-FAVORITE-LANGUAGE` and
    its content to another location. In Python it is sufficient to copy the 
    file [`example_experiment_for_beginners.py`](./code-experiments/build/python/example_experiment_for_beginners.py)
    or [`example_experiment2.py`](./code-experiments/build/python/example_experiment2.py).
    Run the example experiment (it already is compiled). As the details vary, see
    the respective read-me's and/or example experiment files:

    - `C` [read me](./code-experiments/build/c/README.md) 
      and [example experiment](./code-experiments/build/c/example_experiment.c)
    - `Java` [read me](./code-experiments/build/java/README.md)
      and [example experiment](./code-experiments/build/java/ExampleExperiment.java)
    - `Matlab/Octave` [read me](./code-experiments/build/matlab/README.md)
      and [example experiment](./code-experiments/build/matlab/exampleexperiment.m) 
    - `Python` [read me](./code-experiments/build/python/README.md)
      and [example experiment2](./code-experiments/build/python/example_experiment2.py)

    If the example experiment runs, **connect** your favorite algorithm
    to Coco: replace the call to the random search optimizer in the
    example experiment file by a call to your algorithm (see above).
    **Update** the output `result_folder`, the `algorithm_name` and `algorithm_info` 
    of the observer options in the example experiment file.

    Another entry point for your own experiments can be the `code-experiments/examples`
    folder.

5. Now you can **run** your favorite algorithm on the `bbob` and `bbob-largescale` suites
  (for single-objective algorithms), on the `bbob-biobj` suite (for multi-objective 
  algorithms), or on the mixed-integer suites (`bbob-mixint` and `bbob-biobj-mixint` 
  respectively). Output is automatically generated in the 
  specified data `result_folder`. By now, more suites might be available, see below. 

6. <a name="Getting-Started-pp"></a>**Postprocess** the data from the results folder by
  typing

    ```sh
        python -m cocopp [-o OUTPUT_FOLDERNAME] YOURDATAFOLDER [MORE_DATAFOLDERS]
    ```

    Any subfolder in the folder arguments will be searched for logged data. That is, 
  experiments from different batches can be in different folders collected under a 
  single "root"  `YOURDATAFOLDER` folder. We can also compare more than one algorithm 
  by specifying several data result folders generated by different algorithms.

7. We also provide many **archived algorithm data sets**. For example

    ```sh
      python -m cocopp 'bbob/2009/BFGS_ros' 'bbob/2010/IPOP-ACTCMA'
    ```

    processes the referenced archived BFGS data set and an IPOP-CMA data set. The given substring must
    have a unique match in the archive or must end with `!` or `*` or must be a
    [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax)
    containing a `*` and not ending with `!` or `*`. Otherwise, all matches are listed
    but none is processed with this call. For more information in how to obtain
    and display specific archived data, see
    [`help(cocopp)`](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/apidocs-cocopp/cocopp.html) or
    [`help(cocopp.archives)`](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/apidocs-cocopp/cocopp.archiving.OfficialArchives.html)
    or the class
    [`COCODataArchive`](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/apidocs-cocopp/cocopp.archiving.COCODataArchive.html).

    Data descriptions can be found for the `bbob` test suite at
    [coco-algorithms](https://numbbo.github.io/data-archive/bbob/) and for the `bbob-biobj`
    test suite at [coco-algorithms-biobj](https://numbbo.github.io/data-archive/bbob-biobj/).
    For other test suites, please see the [COCO data archive](https://numbbo.github.io/data-archive/).

    Local and archived data can be freely mixed like

    ```sh
      python -m cocopp YOURDATAFOLDER 'bbob/2010/IPOP-ACT'
    ```

    which processes the data from `YOURDATAFOLDER` and the archived IPOP-ACT data
    set in comparison.

    The output folder, `ppdata` by default, contains all output from 
    the post-processing. The `index.html` file is the main entry point to 
    explore the result with a browser. Data from the same foldername as
    previously processed may be overwritten. If this is not desired, a different
    output folder name can be chosen with the `-o OUTPUT_FOLDERNAME` option.

    A summary pdf can be produced via LaTeX. The corresponding templates can be found 
    in the `code-postprocessing/latex-templates` folder.  Basic html output is also 
    available in the result folder of the postprocessing (file `templateBBOBarticle.html`).

8. In order to exploit more features of the post-processing module,
  it is advisable to use the module within a [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  or [IPython](https://ipython.org/) shell
  or a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or
  [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), where

    ```python
    import cocopp
    help(cocopp)
    ```

    provides the [documentation entry pointer](https://numbbo.github.io/gforge/apidocs-cocopp/cocopp.html).

7. Once your algorithm runs well, **increase the budget** in your experiment
  script, if necessary implement randomized independent restarts, and follow 
  the above steps successively until you are happy.
  
8. The experiments can be **parallelized** with any re-distribution of single
  problem instances to batches (see
  [`example_experiment2.py`](./code-experiments/build/python/example_experiment2.py#L100) 
  for an example). Each batch must write in a different target folder (this
  should happen automatically). Results of each batch must be kept under their
  separate folder as is. These folders then must be moved/copied into a single
  folder which becomes the input folder to the post-processing. (The
  post-processing searches in all subfolders and subsub... for `.info` files
  to begin with. The folder structure of a single sub-experiment must not be
  changed, as the `.info` file relies on it to find the data files.)
  
  
If you detect bugs or other issues, please let us know by opening an issue in
our issue tracker at https://github.com/numbbo/coco/issues.

## Description by Folder

* the `do.py` file in the root folder is a tool to build the entire
  distribution. `do.py` is a neat and simplifying replacement for make. It has
  switches for just building some languages etc, type
  ```
    python do.py
  ```
  to see a list of all available commandes. 

* the code-experiments/build folder is to a large extend the output folder of
  the `./do.py build` command.
   - the `exampleexperiment.???` files in the build folder are the entry points to
     understand the usage of the code (as end-user). They are supposed to
     actually be executable (in case, after compilation, which should be taken
     care of by `do.py` and/or `make`) and run typically random search on (some of)
     the provided benchmark suites.

* documentation and examples might not be too meaningful for the time being,
  even though code-experiments/documentation/onion.py describes a (heavily) used
  design pattern (namely: inheritance) in a comparatively understandable way
  (though the implementation in C naturally looks somewhat different). Section 
  [Links and Documentation](https://github.com/numbbo/coco#links-and-documentation-)
  provides a list of pointers.

* the code-experiments/src folder is where most of the important/interesting
  things happen. Many files provide comparatively decent documentation at the
  moment which are translated via doxygen into a more readable web page at
  http://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/C/. Generally:
  - [coco.h](./code-experiments/src/coco.h) is the public interface, in particular
    as used in the example_experiment.c file
  - coco_internal.h provides the type definition of coco_problem_t
  - coco_suite.c is code that deals with an entire benchmark suite (i.e. a set of
    functions, eg. sweeping through them etc...)
  - coco_generics.c is somewhat generic code, e.g. defining a function call via
    coco_evaluate_function etc
  - coco_problem.c is the implementation of the coco_problem_t type/object
    (allocation etc).
  - observer / logger files implement data logging (as wrappers around a coco
    problem inheriting thereby all properties of a coco problem)
  - most other files implement more or less what they say, e.g. the actual
    benchmark functions, transformations, benchmark suites, etc.
  - currently, the following benchmark suites and corresponding logging facilities are
    supported:
    * `bbob`: standard single-objective BBOB benchmark suite with 24 noiseless,
      scalable test functions
    * `bbob-biobj`: a bi-objective benchmark suite, combining 10 selected
      functions from the bbob suite, resulting in 55 noiseless functions
    * `bbob-largescale`: a version of the `bbob` benchmark suite with dimensions
      20 to 640, employing permuted block-diagonal matrices to reduce the 
      execution time for function evaluations in higher dimension.
    * `bbob-mixint`: a mixed-integer version of the original `bbob` and
      `bbob-largescale` suites in which 80% of the variables have been discretized
    * `bbob-biobj-mixint`: a version of the (so far not supported) `bbob-biobj-ext`
      test suite with 92 functions with 80% discretized variables
    * `toy`: a simple, probably easier-to-understand example for reading and testing

* code-experiments/tools are a few meta-tools, mainly the amalgamate.py to merge all
  the C code into one file

* code-experiments/test contains unit- and integration-tests, mainly for internal use

* code-postprocessing/cocopp contains the postprocessing code, written in
  python, with which algorithm data sets can be read in and the performance of
  the algorithms can be displayed in terms of data profiles, aRT vs. dimension
  plots, or simple tables.

* code-postprocessing/helper-scripts contains additional, independent python scripts 
  that are not part of the cocopp module but that might use it.
  
* code-postprocessing/latex-templates contains LaTeX templates for displaying
  algorithm performances in publisher-conform PDFs for the GECCO
  conference.

* code-preprocessing/archive-update/ contains internal code for combining
  the archives of algorithms to create/update the hypervolume
  reference values for the `bbob-biobj` test suite

* code-preprocessing/log-reconstruction/ contains internal code for reconstructing
  output of the `bbob-biobj` logger from archive files (needed when the hypervolume
  reference values are updated)

* howtos contains a few text files with generic howtos.


Known Issues / Trouble-Shooting <a name="Known-Issues"></a>
-------------------------------
### Java
#### `javah` call fails
If you see something like this when running `python do.py run-java` or `build-java`
under Linux
```
COPY    code-experiments/src/coco.h -> code-experiments/build/java/coco.h
WRITE   code-experiments/build/java/REVISION
WRITE   code-experiments/build/java/VERSION
RUN     javac CocoJNI.java in code-experiments/build/java
RUN     javah CocoJNI in code-experiments/build/java
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "do.py", line 590, in <module>
    main(sys.argv[1:])
  File "do.py", line 563, in main
    elif cmd == 'build-java': build_java()
  File "do.py", line 437, in build_java
    env = os.environ, universal_newlines = True)
  File "/..../code-experiments/tools/cocoutils.py", line 34, in check_output
    raise error
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['locate', 'jni.h']' returned non-zero exit status 1
```
it means `javah` is either not installed (see above) or cannot be found in the system
path, see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13526701/javah-missing-after-jdk-install-linux)
and possibly [this](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/issues/416) for a solution. 

### Matlab

#### Path to matlab
If you see something like this when running `python do.py build-matlab`
```
AML	['code-experiments/src/coco_generics.c', 'code-experiments/src/coco_random.c', 'code-experiments/src/coco_suite.c', 'code-experiments/src/coco_suites.c', 'code-experiments/src/coco_observer.c', 'code-experiments/src/coco_runtime_c.c'] -> code-experiments/build/matlab/coco.c
COPY	code-experiments/src/coco.h -> code-experiments/build/matlab/coco.h
COPY	code-experiments/src/best_values_hyp.txt -> code-experiments/build/matlab/best_values_hyp.txt
WRITE	code-experiments/build/matlab/REVISION
WRITE	code-experiments/build/matlab/VERSION
RUN	matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -r setup, exit in code-experiments/build/matlab
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "do.py", line 447, in <module>
    main(sys.argv[1:])
  File "do.py", line 429, in main
    elif cmd == 'build-matlab': build_matlab()
  File "do.py", line 278, in build_matlab
    run('code-experiments/build/matlab', ['matlab', '-nodisplay', '-nosplash', '-r', 'setup, exit'])
  File "/Users/auger/workviasvn/newcoco/numbbo/code-experiments/tools/cocoutils.py", line 68, in run
    universal_newlines=True)
  File "//anaconda/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 566, in check_output
    process = Popen(stdout=PIPE, *popenargs, **kwargs)
  File "//anaconda/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 710, in __init__
    errread, errwrite)
  File "//anaconda/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 1335, in _execute_child
    raise child_exception
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```
it might be because your system does not know the `matlab` command. To fix this,
you should edit the file `/etc/paths` and add the path to the `matlab` bin file 
(Linux/Mac) or add the path to the folder where the `matlab.exe` lies to your 
Windows path. For instance, the `etc/paths` should look like something like this
```
/usr/local/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/Applications/MATLAB_R2012a.app/bin/
```

#### SMS-EMOA example does not compile under Mac 
With the more complex SMS-EMOA example, the problem is related to the compilation
of the external C++ hypervolume calculation in `hv.cpp`. 

A fix for this issue consists in adding to the files `hv.cpp` and `paretofront.c`
```
#define char16_t UINT16_T
```
just before the line:
```
#include "mex.h"
```

#### Access to mex files denied
If it happens that you get some `Access is denied` errors during
`python do.py build-matlab` or `python do.py run-matlab` like this one
```
C:\Users\dimo\Desktop\numbbo-brockho>python do.py run-matlab
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "do.py", line 649, in <module>
    main(sys.argv[1:])
  File "do.py", line 630, in main
    elif cmd == 'run-matlab': run_matlab()
  File "do.py", line 312, in run_matlab
    os.remove( filename )
WindowsError: [Error 5] Access is denied: 'code-experiments/build/matlab\\cocoEv
aluateFunction.mexw32'
```
a reason can be that a previously opened Matlab window still has some
file handles open. Simply close all Matlab windows (and all running Matlab
processes if there is any) before to run the `do.py` command again.


### Octave

#### `octave-dev` under Linux
When running 
```
  python do.py run-octave
```
or 
```
  python do.py build-octave
```
and seeing something like
```
   [...]
   compiling cocoCall.c...error: mkoctfile: please install the Debian package "liboctave-dev" to get the mkoctfile command
```
then, unsurprisingly, installing `liboctave-dev` like
```
  sudo apt-get install liboctave-dev
```
should do the job. 


### Python

#### `setuptools` is not installed
If you see something like this
```
$ python do.py run-python  # or build-python
[...]
PYTHON  setup.py install --user in code-experiments/build/python
ERROR: return value=1
Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "setup.py", line 8, in <module>
   import setuptools
ImportError: No module named setuptools

Traceback (most recent call last):
 File "do.py", line 562, in <module>
   main(sys.argv[1:])
 File "do.py", line 539, in main
   elif cmd == 'build-python': build_python()
 File "do.py", line 203, in build_python
   python('code-experiments/build/python', ['setup.py', 'install', '--user'])
 File "/vol2/twagner/numbbo/code-experiments/tools/cocoutils.py", line 92, in python
   universal_newlines=True)
 File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/subprocess.py", line 575, in check_output
   raise CalledProcessError(retcode, cmd, output=output)
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['/usr/local/bin/python', 'setup.py', 'install', '--user']' returned non-zero exit status 1
```
then `setuptools` needs to be installed: 
```
    pip install setuptools
```
or `easy_install setuptools` should do the job. 

#### Compilation During Install of `cocoex` Fails (under Linux) 
If you see something like this:
``` 
$ python do.py run-python  # or build-python
[...]
cython/interface.c -o build/temp.linux-i686-2.6/cython/interface.o
cython/interface.c:4:20: error: Python.h: file not found
cython/interface.c:6:6: error: #error Python headers needed to compile C extensions, please install development version of Python.
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
```
or
```
$ python do.py run-python  # or build-python
[...]
cython/interface.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/cython/interface.o
cython/interface.c:4:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
#include "Python.h"
^
compilation terminated.
error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
```
Under Linux
```
  sudo apt-get install python-dev
```
should do the trick. 

#### Module Update/Install Does Not Propagate
We have observed a case where the update of the `cocoex` Python module seemed to have no 
effect. In this case it has been successful to remove all previously installed versions, 
see [here](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/issues/586) for a few more details. 


#### Installing `cocoex` after migrating macOS to the ARM chipset (M1 or M2)
Reinstall the Xcode command line tools with
```
xcode-select install
```
and uninstall previous versions of `cocoex`
```
pip uninstall cocoex
```
until the message
```
WARNING: Skipping cocoex as it is not installed.
```
appears. Then
```
python do.py run-python
```
in the coco home folder should do the job.


### Post-Processing

#### Too long paths for postprocessing
It can happen that the postprocessing fails due to too long paths to the algorithm data.
Unfortunately, the error you get in this case does not indicate directly to the problem
but only tells that a certain file could not be read. Please try to shorten the
folder names in such a case.


#### Font issues in PDFs
We have occasionally observed some font issues in the pdfs, produced by the postprocessing
of COCO (see also issue [#1335](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/issues/1335)). Changing to 
another `matplotlib` version solved the issue at least temporarily.

#### BibTeX under Mac
Under the Mac operating system, `bibtex` seems to be messed up a bit with respect to
absolute and relative paths which causes problems with the test of the postprocessing
via `python do.py test-postprocessing`. Note that there is typically nothing to fix if 
you compile the LaTeX templates "by hand" or via your LaTeX IDE. But to make the  
`python do.py test-postprocessing` work, you will have to add a line with
`openout_any = a` to your `texmf.cnf` file in the local TeX path. Type 
`kpsewhich texmf.cnf` to find out where this file actually is.

#### Postprocessing not installable
If for some reason, your python installation is corrupted and running
`python do.py install-postprocessing` crashes with an error message like
```
[...]
    safe = scan_module(egg_dir, base, name, stubs) and safe
  File "C:\Users\dimo\Anaconda2\lib\site-packages\setuptools\command\bdist_egg.py", line 392, in sca
n_module
    code = marshal.load(f)
EOFError: EOF read where object expected
[...]
```
try adding `zip_safe=False` to the `setup.py.in` file in the `code-postprocessing`
folder. More details can be found in the issue [#1373](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/issues/1373).

#### Algorithm appears twice in the figures
Earlier versions of `cocopp` have written extracted data to a folder named `_extracted_...`. 
If the post-processing is invoked with a `*` argument, these folders become an argument and 
are displayed (most likely additionally to the original algorithm data folder). Solution: 
remove the `_extracted_...` folders _and_ use the latest version of the post-processing
module `cocopp` (since release 2.1.1).


Details
-------
- The C code features an object oriented implementation, where the
  `coco_problem_t` is the most central data structure / object. `coco.h`,
  `example_experiment.c` and `coco_internal.h` are probably the best pointers to
  start __to investigate the code__ (but see also 
  [here](https://numbbo.github.io/coco-doc/C/annotated.html)). `coco_problem_t`
  defines a benchmark function instance (in a given dimension), and is called
  via `coco_evaluate_function`.

- Building, running, and testing of the code is done by merging/amalgamation of
  all C-code into a single C file, `coco.c`, and `coco.h`. (by calling `do.py`,
  see above). Like this it becomes very simple to include/use the code in
  different projects.

- [Cython](http://docs.cython.org/src/quickstart/install.html) is used to
  compile the C to Python interface in `build/python/interface.pyx`. The Python
  module installation file `setup.py` uses the compiled `interface.c`, if
  `interface.pyx` has not changed. For this reason, Cython is not a requirement
  for the end-user.

- We continuously test the code through the open source automation server
  Jenkins on one ubuntu 12.04 machine, one OSX 10.9 machine, and two 32-bit
  Windows 7 machines (one with and one without cygwin).
